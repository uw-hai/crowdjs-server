   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the crowdjs-server documentation!
============================================

This documents the REST API of the crowdJS server.

API endpoints
-------------

Note: this section is automatically generated from the API code.

.. autoflask:: app:app
    :endpoints:
    :undoc-static:
    :include-empty-docstring:

(TODO) Resources
----------------

Would like to document our resource types (Tasks, Questions, etc.),
ideally autogenerated from the Document definitions in schema/

The document definitions using Flask-Mongoengine don't seem to work with the autodoc tool,
so that won't appear here for now.

# Example of how this could be done:
# User-facing fields in the schema can be documented with a "#:" comment on the preceding line

#.. currentmodule: schema.task

#.. autoclass:: schema.task.Task
#       :members:

**Example of manual documentation of a resource:**

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "answer_id" : "1234",
        "value" : "0"
        "question_id" : "555",
        "task_id" : "987",
        "worker_id" : "888888",
        "status" : "Completed"
    }

(TODO) Indices and tables
=========================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
