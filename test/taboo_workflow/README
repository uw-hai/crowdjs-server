To run the taboo workflow test, simply run python test.py. This test assumes that you have a server running somewhere, and you have created a requester account with it. 

Create a file config.json in this directory like so:
{
    "crowdjs_url": "http://<server_url:port>",
    "test_requester_email": "<requester account email>",
    "test_requester_password": "<requester account password>"
}
